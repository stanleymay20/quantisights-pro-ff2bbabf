      { id: "OG-1", question: "Does your organization have a formal information security program?", answer: "Yes. Quantivis maintains a formal information security program with documented policies covering access control, data classification, incident response, and secure development lifecycle. Controls are aligned with SOC 2 Type II criteria." },
      { id: "OG-2", question: "Do you have a designated security officer or team?", answer: "Yes. Security responsibilities are assigned to a dedicated team. Security architecture decisions are reviewed before deployment. Contact: security@quantivis.io." },
      { id: "OG-3", question: "Is there a risk management process in place?", answer: "Yes. Risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated through regular review cycles. Our architecture enforces least-privilege access, immutable audit trails, and database-level data isolation as structural risk controls." },
      { id: "OG-4", question: "What is your SOC 2 certification status?", answer: "Our infrastructure provider holds SOC 2 Type II certification. Quantivis has aligned its application-level controls to SOC 2 criteria (access control, audit logging, encryption, change management). A formal SOC 2 Type II audit for Quantivis as an entity is planned." },

  {
    title: "Data Protection & Privacy",
    icon: Lock,
    items: [
      { id: "DP-1", question: "How is data encrypted at rest and in transit?", answer: "All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 via the managed PostgreSQL service. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3. No unencrypted channels are supported." },
      { id: "DP-2", question: "Is customer data isolated between tenants?", answer: "Yes. Multi-tenant isolation is enforced at the database layer via Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on 100% of tables. Every query is scoped to organization_id. No cross-organization data access is architecturally possible." },
      { id: "DP-3", question: "Do you process data in compliance with GDPR?", answer: "Yes. We offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), support Subject Access Requests (SAR) via automated data export, and implement GDPR-compliant account deletion that purges data across 25+ tables. Our subprocessor list is publicly disclosed." },
      { id: "DP-4", question: "Where is customer data stored geographically?", answer: "Primary data storage (databases, file storage, backups) is located within the European Union (AWS EU-West-1, Ireland). Data transferred to subprocessors outside the EU is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)." },
      { id: "DP-5", question: "What is your data retention and deletion policy?", answer: "Configurable freshness policies are available per dataset. Account deletion triggers atomic purge across 25+ tables and removes the user from the authentication system. Database backups are encrypted and retained for 7 days on a rolling basis; deleted data may persist in backups until natural expiry." },
      { id: "DP-6", question: "Is customer data used to train AI/ML models?", answer: "No. Customer data is never used to train, fine-tune, or improve Quantivis models. AI features use third-party inference APIs (Google Gemini) in stateless, per-request mode — no data is retained by the provider after processing." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Access Control & Authentication",
    icon: KeyRound,
    items: [
      { id: "AC-1", question: "What authentication mechanisms are supported?", answer: "Email/password authentication with mandatory password strength validation (including HaveIBeenPwned breach database checking). JWT-based session management with automatic token refresh. No anonymous sign-ups are permitted." },
      { id: "AC-2", question: "Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) supported and enforced?", answer: "Yes. MFA is enforced at the route level using AAL2 (Authenticator Assurance Level 2). Users must complete a TOTP-based second-factor challenge to access protected pages. MFA cannot be bypassed." },
      { id: "AC-3", question: "How is role-based access control implemented?", answer: "Five roles are supported: Owner, Admin, Executive, Analyst, and Viewer. Roles are stored in a dedicated user_roles table (never on the profile). Access is enforced at the database layer via RLS policies using security-definer functions, preventing privilege escalation." },
      { id: "AC-4", question: "Are there least-privilege controls for sensitive data?", answer: "Yes. Strategic tables (decision_ledger, advisory_instances, decision_simulations, executive_modes, executive_briefs) use RESTRICTIVE RLS policies limiting access to Owner, Admin, and Executive roles. Viewers and Analysts cannot access strategic intelligence." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Infrastructure & Network Security",
    icon: Server,
    items: [
      { id: "IN-1", question: "Where is your application hosted?", answer: "Quantivis is hosted on managed infrastructure (AWS) with SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified data centers. Database services run on managed PostgreSQL with automated encrypted backups and point-in-time recovery." },
      { id: "IN-2", question: "Are secrets and API keys managed securely?", answer: "Yes. All secrets (API keys, service role keys, webhook secrets) are stored in encrypted vault storage and injected as environment variables. Service role keys are never exposed to client-side code. The client bundle only contains the publishable anon key." },
      { id: "IN-3", question: "What DDoS and network-level protections are in place?", answer: "DDoS protection and network-level firewalling are provided by the infrastructure layer. Edge functions include code-level rate limiting for sensitive operations." },
      { id: "IN-4", question: "How are backups managed?", answer: "Automated encrypted backups are provided by the managed database service with point-in-time recovery. Backup retention follows the infrastructure provider's schedule." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Audit & Monitoring",
    icon: ScrollText,
    items: [
      { id: "AM-1", question: "Do you maintain audit logs of user and system actions?", answer: "Yes. A comprehensive audit_log table records actor ID, actor type, action type, resource type, resource ID, payload, IP address, and timestamp for every significant action. The audit log is append-only — no UPDATE or DELETE RLS policies exist." },
      { id: "AM-2", question: "Can audit logs be tampered with?", answer: "No. The audit_log table has no UPDATE or DELETE RLS policies. Records are immutable by design. Even administrators cannot alter or remove audit entries through the application." },
      { id: "AM-3", question: "Is there a decision audit trail?", answer: "Yes. The decision_ledger tracks the full lifecycle: predict → decide → execute → measure. Each decision records confidence scores, chosen actions, outcomes, calibration errors, and attribution data. This is restricted to leadership roles." },
      { id: "AM-4", question: "Are AI outputs auditable?", answer: "Yes. AI explanations are stored with full feature attribution, confidence breakdowns, and model identification. An intelligence_audit_trail table records input data, output data, model used, processing time, and confidence scores for every AI operation." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Incident Response & Business Continuity",
    icon: AlertTriangle,
    items: [
      { id: "IR-1", question: "Do you have a documented incident response process?", answer: "Yes. Our incident response process includes: (1) detection and containment, (2) forensic investigation, (3) customer notification within 72 hours where required by applicable law, and (4) post-incident review with remediation." },
      { id: "IR-2", question: "How are customers notified in the event of a breach?", answer: "We notify affected customers without undue delay where required by applicable law. Under GDPR Article 33, this means within 72 hours of confirmed detection. Notification includes the nature of the breach, data affected, and remediation steps taken." },
      { id: "IR-3", question: "What is your disaster recovery strategy?", answer: "Daily encrypted backups with 7-day rolling retention. Target RPO: 24 hours. Target RTO: 4 hours. Infrastructure runs on managed services with built-in redundancy. Application logic is stateless and can be redeployed immediately." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Third-Party & Subprocessor Management",
    icon: Network,
    items: [
      { id: "TP-1", question: "Who are your subprocessors?", answer: "AWS (EU infrastructure), Stripe (payments, PCI DSS Level 1), Google (AI inference, stateless), and Resend (transactional email). Full list with purposes, regions, and safeguards is published at /subprocessors." },
      { id: "TP-2", question: "How are subprocessors evaluated?", answer: "Subprocessors are selected based on security certifications (SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001), data residency options, and contractual data protection obligations. We provide 30 days' advance notice before adding or replacing a subprocessor." },
      { id: "TP-3", question: "Is a DPA available?", answer: "Yes. A GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreement is available for all customers at /dpa. It covers data processing purposes, security measures, subprocessor obligations, and data subject rights." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "AI Governance & Explainability",
    icon: Eye,
    items: [
      { id: "AI-1", question: "How do you ensure AI transparency?", answer: "All AI outputs include confidence scores and feature attribution explanations. Counterfactual analysis shows what would need to change for a different recommendation. Cognitive bias detection monitors recommendation quality." },
      { id: "AI-2", question: "Is there cross-organization learning?", answer: "No. There is no cross-organization learning. AI insights are generated per-request using only the requesting organization's data. No patterns or intelligence are shared between organizations without explicit opt-in." },
      { id: "AI-3", question: "How are AI confidence scores calibrated?", answer: "Confidence scores are capped using a data-quality-aware system that accounts for sample size, data freshness, and variance. Calibration assessments track overconfidence and underconfidence over time. Historical calibration errors are recorded and used to adjust future outputs." },
