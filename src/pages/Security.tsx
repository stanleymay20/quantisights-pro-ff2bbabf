QUANTIVIS SECURITY WHITEPAPER
Decision Governance Platform — Security Architecture Overview
Generated: ${date}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
────────────────────
Quantivis is a Decision Governance platform that processes sensitive strategic 
and financial data for executive leadership teams. This whitepaper documents 
the security architecture, data protection mechanisms, and compliance posture 
that protect your organization's most critical intelligence.

Our security model is built on four foundational principles:
  • Defense in Depth — Multiple independent security layers
  • Least Privilege — Minimum access required for each role
  • Zero Trust — Every request is authenticated and authorized
  • Transparency — All AI outputs are auditable and explainable


2. INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY
──────────────────────────
Hosting & Encryption:
  • All data encrypted at rest using AES-256
  • All data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
  • Hosted on SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified infrastructure
  • Automated encrypted backups with point-in-time recovery
  • DDoS protection and network-level firewalling
  • Infrastructure hosted in EU-compliant data centers

Secret Management:
  • Service role keys stored exclusively in encrypted Edge Function secrets
  • Client-side code only receives the anonymous (anon) key
  • API keys rotated on a regular schedule
  • Environment variables never committed to source control


3. AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL
───────────────────────────────────
Authentication:
  • Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced at route level (AAL2)
  • TOTP-based authenticator apps supported (Google Authenticator, Authy)
  • JWT-based session management with automatic token refresh
  • Secure password reset flow with expiring, single-use tokens

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  ┌─────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
  │ Role        │ Strategic │ Metrics  │ Config    │ Audit    │ Team     │
  ├─────────────┼───────────┼──────────┼───────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
  │ Owner       │    ✓      │    ✓     │    ✓      │    ✓     │    ✓     │
  │ Admin       │    ✓      │    ✓     │    ✓      │    ✓     │    ✓     │
  │ Executive   │    ✓      │    ✓     │    ✗      │    ✗     │    ✗     │

  │ Viewer      │    ✗      │    ✗     │    ✗      │    ✗     │    ✗     │
  └─────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

  Strategic data (Decision Ledger, Advisory, Simulations) is restricted
  to Owner, Admin, and Executive roles at the database policy layer.

Permission System:
  • 14 granular permissions (dashboard.view, decisions.approve, data.upload, etc.)
  • Permissions enforced via SECURITY DEFINER database functions
  • Role defaults with explicit per-organization overrides
  • Permission checks occur at both UI and database layers


4. MULTI-TENANT DATA ISOLATION
──────────────────────────────
  • Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforced on 100% of public tables
  • All queries scoped to organization_id at the PostgreSQL layer
  • Cross-organization data access is architecturally impossible
  • Organization membership verified on every API request
  • Edge Functions validate JWT + org membership before processing

  This isolation is enforced at the DATABASE level, not the application level.
  Even if application code contained a bug, RLS policies would prevent 
  unauthorized data access.


5. IMMUTABLE AUDIT TRAIL
────────────────────────
  • Comprehensive audit_log recording: actor, action, resource, payload, IP
  • No UPDATE or DELETE policies on audit tables — immutable by design
  • Decision Ledger tracks full lifecycle: predict → decide → execute → measure
  • Calibration history preserves AI confidence evolution over time
  • Intelligence audit trail records all AI-generated outputs with provenance
  • Full data export available for compliance (GDPR Art. 20)


6. AI DATA GOVERNANCE
─────────────────────
Data Processing:
  • Client data is NOT used to train or fine-tune Quantivis models
  • Third-party AI inference is stateless and per-request
  • No data is retained by AI providers after processing
  • No cross-organization learning without explicit opt-in

PII Redaction:
  • Automatic PII detection and redaction before AI processing
  • Patterns detected: emails, phone numbers, IBANs, credit cards, SSNs, UUIDs
  • AI Data Boundary toggle (disabled by default) controls raw text exposure
  • Organizations can audit exactly what data was sent to AI models

Anti-Hallucination Framework:
  • 5-layer epistemic integrity system
  • Confidence capping at 90% maximum
  • Evidence classification (OBSERVED_FACT vs AI_RECOMMENDATION)
  • All AI outputs include confidence scores and attribution
  • Counterfactual analysis provides reasoning transparency


7. COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────
GDPR Compliance:
  • Data Processing Agreement (DPA) available for all customers
  • Account deletion purges data across 25+ tables
  • Configurable data retention policies per organization
  • Automated data export for Subject Access Requests (SAR)
  • Cookie policy limited to essential session cookies — no tracking

Sub-processor Transparency:
  • Full sub-processor list publicly available
  • Contractual data protection obligations with all sub-processors
  • Customer notification for sub-processor changes

Incident Response:
  • Affected customers notified within 72 hours (per GDPR Art. 33)
  • Documented incident response procedure
  • Post-incident review and remediation tracking


8. SECURITY POSTURE SCORING
───────────────────────────
Quantivis maintains a real-time Security Posture Dashboard scoring (0-100):
  • RLS coverage across all tables
  • Encryption status (at rest and in transit)
  • AI Data Boundary configuration
  • Audit trail integrity verification
  • MFA enrollment rate across team members
  • Rate limiting configuration

Organizations can view their current score and recommendations for
improvement directly within their settings dashboard.


9. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
─────────────────────────
We maintain a public security.txt policy for vulnerability reporting.
Security researchers can report issues to: security@quantivis.io

We commit to:
  • Acknowledging reports within 48 hours
  • Providing status updates every 5 business days
  • Not pursuing legal action against good-faith researchers

const SECURITY_FAQ = [
  { q: "Is Quantivis SOC 2 certified?", a: "Our infrastructure provider holds SOC 2 Type II certification. Quantivis has aligned its application-level controls to SOC 2 standards — including RLS enforcement, immutable audit logging, MFA, and encrypted secrets management. A formal SOC 2 Type II audit for Quantivis as an entity is planned." },
  { q: "Where is my data stored?", a: "All data is stored in managed PostgreSQL databases hosted in SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certified data centers. Encryption at rest uses AES-256. Backups are automated and encrypted." },
  { q: "Can Quantivis employees access my data?", a: "No. All data access is scoped by organization_id at the database layer via Row-Level Security. Administrative access to infrastructure is limited to a small team with MFA and audit logging." },
  { q: "How do you handle a security breach?", a: "We follow GDPR Article 33 requirements: affected customers are notified within 72 hours where required by applicable law. Our incident response process includes containment, forensic investigation, customer communication, and post-incident review." },
  { q: "What happens when I delete my account?", a: "A secure Edge Function performs atomic deletion or anonymization across 25+ tables (metrics, advisories, audit logs, decisions, copilot sessions, etc.) and purges your record from the authentication system." },
  { q: "Do you train AI models on my data?", a: "No. Client data is not used to train, fine-tune, or improve Quantivis models. AI features use third-party inference APIs (e.g. Google Gemini) in stateless, per-request mode — no data is retained by the provider after processing." },
  { q: "How is MFA enforced?", a: "MFA is enforced at the route level using AAL2 (Authenticator Assurance Level 2). Users must complete a second-factor challenge to access protected pages. TOTP-based authenticator apps are supported." },
  { q: "Can I get a DPA or subprocessor list?", a: "Yes. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA), subprocessor list, data retention policy, and privacy policy are all publicly available and linked from this page." },
