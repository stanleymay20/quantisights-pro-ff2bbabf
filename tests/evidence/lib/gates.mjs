// Scoring model:
//   - Each gate has an integer weight.
//   - Weights are NOT required to sum to 100.
//   - The Enterprise Readiness Score is normalized to 0-100 as
//     round( earned / TOTAL_WEIGHT * 100 ), where earned is the sum of
//     (weight * factor) over all scoring gates and factor ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}.
//   - Non-scoring gates carry weight 0 (they can still hard-block a release
//     but do not move the score).
