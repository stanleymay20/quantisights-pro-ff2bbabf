# Quantivis Release Gate (EE-1)

The release gate is the **single point of enforcement** between a green build
and a production deployment. No release is enterprise-ready unless **every
gate below is PASS** for the current commit.

The gate is computed by `tests/evidence/run-all.mjs` from the evidence
artifacts written under `audit-artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/<pipeline>/`.

## Gate definition

| Gate | Pipelines (see EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md) | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | 1, 2, 3, 4 | All PASS. No `SECURITY_FAILURE`. |
| Authorization | 5, 32, 33, 34 | All PASS. All negative controls = `EXPECTED_DENIAL`. |
| Tenant isolation | 6, 30, 35 | Zero `CRITICAL_LEAK`. Every probe accounted for. |
| Decision pipeline | 7, 8, 17, 26, 27 | All PASS. Ledger diff matches inputs. |
| Evidence pipeline | 11, 12, 13 | All PASS. Export bundle checksum recorded. |
| Governance pipeline | 9, 10, 19 | All PASS. Stage order matches profile. |
| AI pipeline | 14, 15, 16 | All PASS. Confidence ≤ 0.85. Mock mode used. |
| Audit pipeline | 18 | Append succeeds. UPDATE/DELETE denied. |
| Reporting pipeline | 20, 21 | Deterministic checksum stable across two runs. |
| Notifications | 23 | Cooldown enforced. Org scoped. |
| Billing | 24, 25 | Entitlements = Stripe state. Credits balance ≥ 0. |
| Scalability | 22, 29 | Timings within `PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS.md`. |
| System health | 22, 29, 31, 36 | SLO probes green. Cron jobs recent success. |
| Recovery | 28, 37 | Restore + rollback replay clean. |

## Enforcement

Any of the following blocks the release:

1. Any pipeline status ∈ { `API_FAILURE`, `SECURITY_FAILURE`, `PERFORMANCE_FAILURE`, `CRITICAL_LEAK`, `CRITICAL_FAILURE`, `FRAMEWORK_INVALID` }.
2. Any expected negative control returning success (leak).
3. Any missing evidence artifact listed in the matrix.
4. `commit_sha` in artifacts does not match the release candidate SHA.
5. `environment` in artifacts is not in the guard allow-list (staging / preview).

## Sign-off

The gate report (`audit-artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/RELEASE_GATE.md`) must be
attached to the release ticket. Sign-off requires:

- Engineering lead — technical PASS
- Security — no `SECURITY_FAILURE`, no `CRITICAL_LEAK`
- Compliance — audit + evidence pipelines PASS
- Product — reporting pipeline PASS

## Non-goals

- The release gate does not test production.
- The release gate does not exercise live AI providers.
- The release gate does not send real emails or charge real cards.

## Gate definition (generated from `tests/evidence/lib/gates.mjs`)

Scoring model: weights do not need to sum to 100. The Enterprise
Readiness Score is normalized to 0-100 against TOTAL_WEIGHT = 110.
Gates with weight 0 are hard-blocking but do not contribute to the score.

| Gate key | Label | Weight | Pipelines |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `authentication` | Authentication | 10 | `authentication`, `mfa`, `oauth`, `session-recovery` |
| `authorization` | Authorization | 10 | `authorization` |
| `tenant_isolation` | Tenant Isolation | 15 | `tenant-isolation`, `edge-functions`, `realtime` |
| `decision_pipeline` | Decision Pipeline | 10 | `decision-lifecycle` |
| `evidence_pipeline` | Evidence Pipeline | 10 | `evidence-attachment`, `evidence-retrieval`, `evidence-export` |
| `governance` | Governance | 10 | `governance-workflow`, `confidence-scoring` |
| `ai` | AI Pipeline | 10 | `ai-recommendation`, `ai-explanation` |
| `audit` | Audit | 0 | `audit-trail` |
| `reports` | Reports | 5 | `reports`, `executive-exports` |
| `notifications` | Notifications | 0 | `notifications` |
| `billing` | Billing | 0 | `billing`, `credits` |
| `scalability` | Scalability | 10 | `dashboard-loading`, `background-jobs` |
| `recovery` | Recovery | 10 | `recovery`, `rollback` |
| `system_health` | System Health | 10 | `system-health`, `search`, `data-import`, `dataset-versioning` |

**Total weight (score denominator):** 110
